# About Perception


Perceptron is algorithm made by Frank Rosenblatt in 1957.

Perceptron is origin to deep learing.

Perceptron print a signal to multiple signal.

Perceptron have two value of signal that refer to ‘stream’ or ‘not stream’.

Circle is expressed as (digital) “neuron” or “node”.

W is weight.

Weight is multiplied when input signal is sent to neuron.

Y print 1 when it pass fixed limit to total of signal. = neuron revitalize.

Threshold value’s symbol is theta ‘θ’.


formula: 


machine learning is working to decide a suitable parameter.

Perception can not realize XOR gate. XOR gate is logical circuit to output 1 when just one in x1 or x2 is 1.
