# Artificial Communicator Programme(A.C.P.)

## Background

for efficiently providing confidence and free to people, it is confident to use by people. Human's essential factor is language. Thus, Technology and Robot should comprehend language and speech it. Language is system of communication to use only by human. Natural language is language constructed by Language Acquistion Device(LAD). Natural language processing indicates handling of principle, meaning of natural language. Deductive approach in programing natural language was limits. Inductive method is trouble for human to comprehend result of program constructing artificial neural network.(자료 조사 필요) This method need excessive plenty of resource in coumputer. (자료 조사 필요) I want to make program to construct itself Linguistic principle. I want to make program that human understand result of artificial language acquisition.

## Goal

1. product programe to automatically make gramatical rule, when computer input language message

2. Automatically creating dictionary program When it get language message.

3. Automatical program creating context information matrix , when it get language message.

4. Program speeching language message according to certain context.

## Basic Idea

1. I will make Program to realize language acquisition process

  - The program construct language principle itself, which do not receive input of rule that user make.
  
2. input data is limited. The scope is decided by user.


3. I design program reflected HPSG, transformational generative grammar, etc of universal language rule.

  - using transformational grammar to language development stage.
   
  - using HPSG when language development step complete.

4. User input language data.

5. Program analyse language data(usually sentence) according to associated or integrated relation.

    - to extract language unit according associated relation as result of comparing language data.

    - to extract integrated relation of language units.

    - to save, use with frame based upon HPSG matrix about language unit of arbitrary relation about meaning and expression.


6. This program reflect learning step of Gagne's Theory.

7. This program utilize saving and handling of information efficiently 

    - to use C, C++ as Major programing language.

    - to minimize of momory usage amount.

## Step

I develop program that read text, automatically classify language unit(morpheme, word, sentence, discourse, etc).

I develop program that read text, automatically generate dictionary.

I develop program that generate language principle.
